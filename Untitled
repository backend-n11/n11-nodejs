# REST service

**Create an application, the application should operate with the following resources:**

- `User` (with attributes):
  ```javascript
  { id, name, login, password } TODO: joi ishlatish kerak!
  ```

  ```
- `Task`:
  ```javascript
  {id, title, description, userId} TODO: JOi ishlatish kerak! 
  ```
**Details:**
1. For `User`, `Task` REST endpoints with separate router paths should be created
    * `User` (`/users` route)
      * `GET /users` - get all users (remove password from response)
      * `GET /users/:userId` - get the user by id (ex. “/users/123”) (remove password from response)
      * `POST /users` - create user
      * `PUT /users/:userId` - update user
      * `DELETE /users/:userId` - delete user
    * `Task` (`/tasks` route)
      * `GET /tasks/` - get all tasks
      * `GET /tasks/:taskId` - get the task by id
      * `POST /tasks` - create task
      * `PUT /tasks/:taskId` - update task
      * `DELETE /tasks/:taskId` - delete task
